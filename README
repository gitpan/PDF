New Release: 1.07

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-----------    ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
PDF            bdpO  Access information in a PDF file             ANTRO

The PDF library is a proposed library for access the information 
contained inside a PDF file. PDF stands for Portable Document Format and is
a standard proposed by Adobe ( See http://www.adobe.com/ for more details ) .

Install "as usual" with:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

Then, you can try the scripts in the example directory that tests 
if a file is a PDF ( not looking at the .pdf extension :-), the PDF 
version used to write them, their number of pages and the various 
Info ( Author, Creation date, etc. ).

PREREQUISITES:

A Perl distribution :-)

NEWS:

The library is now able to deal correctly with the cross-platform
PDF standard, i.e. PDF generated on a Mac can be correctly read on a
Unix, for example.  It was a problem partially covered by the previous 
release but still not correctly handled.

AVAILABILITY:

The library is available at 

<http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/4794/>

and at all CPAN mirror 

Enjoy
