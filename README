Proposed Module List Entry:

PDF        adpO  Access information in a PDF file

The PDF library is a proposed library for access the information 
contained inside a PDF file. It is at its early development stage and
a lot of work is necessary, but it works also with this few lines
of code ( see the examples directory ). 

Here are some examples of what it can do:

Install as usual with:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

Then, you can try the scripts in the example directory that tests 
if a file is a PDF ( not looking at the .pdf extension :-), the PDF 
version used to write them and their number of pages.

Enjoy
