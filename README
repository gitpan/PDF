PDF            bdpO  Access information in a PDF file             ANTRO

The PDF library is a proposed library for access the information 
contained inside a PDF file. PDF stands for Portable Document Format and is
a standard proposed by Adobe ( See http://www.adobe.com/ for more details ) .

Install "as usual" with:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

Then, you can try the scripts in the example directory that tests 
if a file is a PDF ( not looking at the .pdf extension :-), the PDF 
version used to write them, their number of pages and the various 
Info ( Author, Creation date, Crypting, etc. ).

PREREQUISITES:

A Perl distribution :-)

Enjoy
